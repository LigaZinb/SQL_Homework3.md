2. Find the date 51 days from today.
3. Format that date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
4. In the `northwind` database, add 3 hours to the `transaction_created_date` from the `inventory_transactions` table.
5. Show a text column: `Client with id <customer_id> placed an order on <order_date>` from the `orders` table using string concatenation and data type conversion (`CAST`).
6. Format all queries with proper style.
7. Save queries in a `.sql` file and upload to the platform or GitHub.
